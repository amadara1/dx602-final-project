    "1) Fixed acidity: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 4.6 to 15.9. With a variance of approximately 3.03, values vary quite significantly considering the range. This refers to the concentration of non-volatile acids in the wine, such as citric acid, that contribute to its overall taste and quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) Volatile acidity: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0.12 to 1.58. The variance is about 0.032. As the name suggests, this refers to the concentration of volatile acids in the wine. These acids contribute to a vinegary smell when present in high concentrations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3) Citric acid: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0 to 1 with a variance of about 0.038, similar to volatile acidity. This refers to the concentration of citric acid in the wine which contributes to its taste. With its relation to fixed acidity, a fair assumption is that fixed acidity and citric acid are positively correlated.\n",
    "\n",
    "4) Residual sugar: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0.9 to 15.5 with a variance of about 1.99. This refers to the amounnt of sugar left after fermentation. Naturally, the higher the amount, the sweeter the wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "5) Chlorides: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0.012 to 0.611 with a relatively low variance of 0.002215. Chlorides, which are the mineral salts in the wine, contribute to its level of saltiness.\n",
    "\n",
    "6) Free sulfur dioxide: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 1 to 72 with a variance of approximately 109, which is a significantly high variance compared to other columns. We can assume this may rank high if you run a principal component analysis on this dataset. This refers to the antioxidant and antimicrobial agent present in wines that act as preservative.\n",
    "\n",
    "7) Total sulfur dioxide: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 6 to 289 with a variance of 1806 which is even higher than free sulfur oxide. The range is also higher/more spread out than other columns. The max value might also be an outlier in this case. This refers to the overall amount of sulfur dioxide in the wine, including the free SO2 and the bound SO2.\n",
    "\n",
    "8) Density: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0.99 to 1.00369 with a relatively low variance of 0.000004. This extremly low variance reveals that wine density hardly vary from wine to wine.\n",
    "\n",
    "9) pH: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 2.74 to 4.01 with a variance of about 0.024, meaning the pH level of the different wine samples vary within a reasonable range.\n",
    "\n",
    "10) Sulphates: This is a numeric column with no missing values. The values range from 0.33 to 2 with a variance of about 0.029. Similar to pH level, the values don't vary that much. This refers to the concentration of sulphates in the wine which is a natural preservative.\n"
